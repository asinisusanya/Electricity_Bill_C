# Electricity Billing System
## Overview
This is a simple Electricity Billing System implemented in C. It allows users to input customer details (ID, name, and units consumed) and calculates the total electricity bill based on the consumption. The charges are calculated based on different slabs:

1.00 per unit for the first 500 units

1.80 per unit for the next 100 units (501 to 600)

2.00 per unit for the next 200 units (601 to 800)

3.00 per unit for any units consumed beyond 800

The system provides a user-friendly interface to input details, calculate the charge, and display the bill. It also allows the user to calculate multiple bills in one session.
